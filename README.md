# Life-Expectancy-Using-various-attributes-by-Implementing-Multiple-Regression

The project aims at identifying factors impacting life expectancy and predicting it using multiple linear regression:
- Analyzed data including life expectancy and various attributes of 193 countries, conducted data preprocessing on data by removing null values and label encoding categorical variables.
- Implemented various feature selection models such as OLS Regression, LassolarsIC and implemented multiple regression on data obtained using the LassoCV model to predict life expectancy
- Further checked the accuracy of the model using real-world values from the WHO dataset.
